# Hi there, I'm Eylül 👋
### UI/UX Designer | Design Systems Architect | Product Thinker

I am a UI/UX Designer dedicated to bridging the gap between high-fidelity design and scalable code. I believe that design is not just how it looks, but how it works as a system. Currently, I'm focused on building a modern web design agency and developing robust design systems using **Atomic Design** principles.

## ✨ Design Philosophy

> "Design is the silent ambassador of your brand."

I focus on **Atomic Design** to ensure that every component—from the smallest button to the largest layout—is reusable, consistent, and easy for developers to implement. My goal is to create interfaces that are as beautiful as they are functional.
